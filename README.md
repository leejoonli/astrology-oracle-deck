### Project Idea
This application is a simple virtual representation of an astrology oracle deck.  This project is a gift for a friend of mine since she likes card readings.

### Tech Stack
- React
- React Native
- Typescript

\*Note: This project could have a backend database to hold all the card information but I feel it is unnecessary and will probably have the data in another file and export it to whatever components I need it in.

### User Stories
MVP
- As a user, I want to be able to tap the deck section so I can randomly choose the cards from the deck.
- As a user, I want to be able to not choose the same card/s so I can have an accurate reading.
- As a user, I want to be able to tap on the selected cards so I can understand what each card represents.
- As a user, I want to be able decide if I want another reading so I can ask more questions.

STRECH GOALS
- As a user, I want to be able to choose how many cards I want to pull from the deck so I can get a more detailed reading.
